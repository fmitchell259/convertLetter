# convertLetter
My solution to question 10, chapter 3 from Java: A beginner's guide. 

Question: Write a program that will convert uppercase letters to their lowercase 
equivalent and vice versa.Each change must be output to the screen, the changes 
must be counted up and the total number of changes displayed when the user 
enters '.' to stop. 

Make no changes to any other character.
